# J124 Final Project: Data Analysis of Tree Cover Loss
## By Heather Fergus
*This dataset was downloaded as a .csv file from Global Forest Watch*
## Data Analysis
### *Notes*
* The dataset notes there was a change in research model around 2011, which impacts comparing data from before 2015 with after 2015. Therefore, the data in this analysis will be filtered to only look at the years 2015 to 2021. 
* This dataset looks at total tree cover loss globally, but this doesn't just include deforestation. This could also be due to conservation efforts, wildfires, human and non-human causes of forest loss. 

#### Question 1: Which year had the highest total tree loss in hectares? Which had the lowest?
1. First I highlighted the data and created a new pivot table in the spreadsheet. 
2. Then I put “Tree_cover_loss_ha” in the values section, with “Year” in rows and filters, to filter for only 2015 to 2021. 
3. I sorted “Tree_cover_loss_ha” to summarize as SUM, as this will determine the total tree loss in that year. Also I sorted the “Year” to be descending by the “Tree_cover_loss_ha” as this will clearly display the highest amount first.
